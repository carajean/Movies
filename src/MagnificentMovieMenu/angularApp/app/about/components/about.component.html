    <ul>
        <li>bring in the MoviesDB api to load movie data, both for autocompleting search fields and suggesting popular movies to add -- I wrote code for this functionality but ran out of time to finish debugging</li>
        <li>bring in Netflix and Amazon Video logins, for cross-platform movie list management</li>
        <li>sort movies alphabetically and chronologically</li>
        <li>rate movies with a 1-5 dropdown, and render respective stars images; then filter movies by unwatched or by rating</li>
    </ul>
