# Movies

The Task
This task is to build a web application that allows you to create lists of movies you’d like to watch.  A person using your app may create a “Horror Movies” list that contains all the horror movies s/he’d like to see. S/he could also have a list of comedies that s/he is interested in watching.  The app needs to allow the user to create as many lists as s/he would like and provide them with the ability to uniquely name each of the lists that s/he creates. After one or more lists are created, the user should be able to add movies to lists, delete movies from lists, and mark movies on the lists as watched by rating movies on the list.
 
Here are the details for the specific features we’d like to see:
Ability to list all “Movies to Watch” lists
Ability to create an unlimited number of “Movies to Watch” lists each with a unique name
Ability to list all movies in a “Movies to Watch” list when it is clicked on.
Ability to add new movies in a “Movies to Watch” list.
When adding a movie to a “Movies to Watch” list, the add feature should auto-populate with movie names from an online movie names API.  It should work similar to how Google predicts what you are looking for by the letter you have typed in.  You can begin auto-populating choices a user can select from after three letters are typed.
Ability to edit/delete movies in a “Movies to Watch” list.
Lists should get saved to a database and loaded and retrieved from that database each time the web application is visited.
(Bonus Points – Not required) Ability to click on a movie name in a list that would open a trailer for the movie online or take you to a rating page for the movie online.
Tech to use
Write a single page app using Angular (https://angular.io). If you have never used Angular before, we recommend doing the Tour of Hero’s tutorial before you begin this project
Write all of your JavaScript and Angular using TypeScript (http://TypeScript.com).  Angular is built entirely in TypeScript.
Use C# ASP.Net Core for the server side of your application making C# Web API REST endpoints for saving and retrieving your data
Use MS SQL or MySQL for a database to store all of your data
Use GitHub for source control
For your auto-populate feature, you may use http://omdbapi.com/ or https://www.themoviedb.org or any other API you find that returns the data you need to do this.
Deploy your project on the web somewhere and send us a link to try it out and send us a link to your GitHub where the source resides.
